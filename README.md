# miningpi

I grabbed one of these "SunFounder Raspberry Pi PCD8544 Shield RAM 84*48 Mini LCD Display"
for like 15 dollars on amazon.

I changed and modified the example code and added some stuff to make it so that it shows the

a.) IPv4 Address of the pi  

b.) 5 second average of the speed of my bitcoin miner. <--> cgminer api socket

c.) api socket server to allow a special message to be displayed through telnet or rest


So to be clear, nothing in this is exactly original I just copy/pasted some stuff from other examples
to beat this thing into whatever it is. 
This is for a Raspberry pi that I use to operate my butterfly labs LC bitcoin miner.
