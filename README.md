# miningpi

I grabbed one of these "SunFounder Raspberry Pi PCD8544 Shield RAM 84*48 Mini LCD Display"
I took the example code and added some stuff to make it so that it shows the 

a.) IP Address of the pi  
b.) 5 second average of the speed of my bitcoin miner. <--> cgminer api socket
c.) api socket server to allow a special message to be displayed through telnet or rest
